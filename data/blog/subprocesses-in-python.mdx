# Introduction

There are many instances when I automate tasks with Python, and it is not always possible to use APIs. Sometimes, I have to resort to using the command-line interface (CLI), and running them as subprocesses comes to the rescue.

The [subprocess module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) in Python enables the `creation, interaction, and management of subprocesses`. It allows a Python script to `spawn external processes, communicate with them, and retrieve their results`. This module is useful for executing system commands, running external programs, and handling input/output streams between the main script and subprocesses. Through the subprocess module, Python provides a versatile and powerful way to seamlessly incorporate external processes into its scripts, enhancing the capabilities and flexibility of Python applications.

# Python subprocess module
    
    You may already be familiar with functions like `call()`, `check_call()`, and `check_output()`, but these belong to the older subprocess API from `Python 3.5` and earlier. Although they are still present in newer Python versions, they are included primarily to provide backward compatibility.

    We will use the subprocess module via the `run()` function, an updated implementation from `Python version 3.8` onwards. It is a `blocking function` that waits for the process to finish. run() can generally cover the maximum use cases, but for some niche edge cases, we have `Popen`, which we will discuss at the end of this article.

# Basic Usage

    All Code available on my github. [here](https://github.com/mythLabs/blog-content/tree/main/python-subprocesses)

    Let's assume we are writing a Python script to manipulate Docker images on a machine, and we want to do this using the CLI installed on that particular machine.

    ```python:subp.py
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["docker", "image", "ls"])
    print("completed")
    ```

    This is a simple code that imports the module and runs the command, which is passed as individual tokens. Below is the result.

    ![Docker](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/01.png)

    It returns an instance of `CompletedProcess class` which returns exit code of the subprocess command.

    ![return code](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/02.png)

    Lets create shell script that we will run as a subprocess. A frequent case that i deal with daily.

    ```bash:bscript.sh
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "running for $1 times"
    x=1
    while [ $x -le $1 ]
    do
        echo "."
        x=$(( $x + 1 ))
        sleep 1
    done
    ```

    This simple bash script generates "." in x amount after 1 second. x is passed a commmand line argument. Looks something like this.

    ![script](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/03.png)

    Now we run this script from our python code.

    ```python:subp.py
    import subprocess
    completed_process = subprocess.run(["./bscript.sh", "4"])
    ```

    # Exception handling

    In real world thing don't always go write. what if there is some sort of error in the subprocess we should handle it.

    Easiest would be to check for `non-zero return code` which are universally regarded as error.

    Lets update our shell script to throw error by using exit with a non-zero code.

    ```shell:bscript.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    exit 12
    echo "running for $1 times"
    x=1
    while [ $x -le $1 ]
    do
        echo "."
        x=$(($x + 1))
        sleep 1
    done
    ```

    so at this point i would like to introduce two important arguments of the run() function:- `check`, `timeout`.
    `check=True` is used to capture exceptions for subprocess; otherwise, it will fail silently.
    `timeout` is employed to set a limit for which run() will `wait for the subprocess command to complete`, as there may be a chance that, due to some problem, the subprocess could run infinitely.

    ```python:subp.py
    import subprocess

    completed_process = subprocess.run(["./bscript.sh", "4"],
                                    check=True,
                                    timeout=10)
    print("completed")
    print(completed_process)
    print(completed_process.returncode)
    ```

    And here is the exception.

    ![exception](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/04.png)

    Apart from a non-zero exit code, there are two more errors that we can handle:
        - If the subprocess command does not exist, it may be due to a typo, etc., and it throws a `FileNotFoundError` error.
        - If the subprocess continues more than the timeout, then it throws a `TimeoutExpired` error."

    Let's create a full-fledged script to handle all exceptions.

    ```python:subp.py
    import subprocess

    try:
        subprocess.run(
            ["./bscript.sh", "4"], timeout=1, check=True
        )
    except FileNotFoundError as exc:
        print(f"Executable not found.\n{exc}")
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as exc:
        print(
            f"Unsuccessful return code."
            f"Returned {exc.returncode}\n{exc}"
        )
    except subprocess.TimeoutExpired as exc:
        print(f"Process timed out.\n{exc}")
    ```

    Here are the results of all types of exceptions.

# Communication

    Streams are the way communication happens with processes.

    When we initialize a process, three streams are created:

    - <strong>stdin</strong>: The process reads input from this.
    - <strong>stdout</strong>: The process writes output to this.
    - <strong>stderr</strong>: The process writes errors to this.

    The subprocess fills up `stdout` and `stderr`, and we fill up `stdin`. Then we read the data in stdout and stderr, and the subprocess reads from stdin.

    To capture the output, we need to use another argument for run(), which is `capture_output=True`.

    Now, let's actually use the data from the subprocess rather than just displaying it.

    ```python:subp.py
    import subprocess

    completed_process = subprocess.run(
        ["./bscript.sh", "4"], timeout=10, check=True, capture_output=True
    )
    print("In main python script")
    print(completed_process.stdout)
    ```
    And here is what we get

    ![use stdout](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/08.png)

    As you can see, it returns data as a `bytes` object, so keep `encoding in mind`.

    Also, the stdout of the `CompletedProcess` is no longer a stream. The stream has been completely read,
    and itâ€™s now stored as byte object in the .stdout.

    To handle encoding, we can use the `encoding="utf-8"` argument of run, and it will give beautiful results.

    ```python:subp.py
        subprocess.run(["./bscript.sh", "4"], timeout=10, check=True, capture_output=True,  encoding="utf-8")
    ```

    ![use stdout](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/09.png)
    
# Popen

    The actual underlying class that is abstracted when we use run() is Popen. When we pass configuration parameters to run(), we are essentially initializing Popen with specific constructor parameters.

    The main distinction lies in the fact that Popen runs `asynchronously`, enabling subprocess execution in `parallel`, while run() is `synchronous`. run() is sufficient for covering the majority of use cases, but for more advanced scenarios, Popen is available at your disposal.

    Let's write a small program and study its output.

    ```python:popen.py
    import subprocess
    from time import sleep

    with subprocess.Popen(
        ["./bscript.sh", "5"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE
    ) as process:

        def poll_and_read():
            print(f"polling: {process.poll()}")
            print(f"stdout: {process.stdout.read1().decode('utf-8')}")

        poll_and_read()
        sleep(2)
        poll_and_read()
        sleep(2)
        poll_and_read()
    ```

    This program invokes our Bash script containing timer code within a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html) using `with`  and assigns its standard output to a pipe.

    The `poll()` method is employed to check whether the process has terminated. If it is still running, it returns `None`; otherwise, it provides the `exit code`.

    Lastly, the program utilizes `.read1()` to read as many bytes as are available from .stdout.

    Here's the output:

    ![popen result](/static/images/blog/subprocesses-in-python/10.png)

    We can observe the transition of polling results from None to 0 (the exit code), along with the standard output output of the subprocess.

# os.system vs subprocess
    - Python.org has `deprecated` os.system and encourages the transition to the newer subprocess module, particularly using run() (recommended since Python 3.5).
    - os.system directly executes the command in a shell, making it susceptible to shell injection, also known as command injection.
