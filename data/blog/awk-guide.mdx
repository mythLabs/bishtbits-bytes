# Introduction

[AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) syntax has always been a mystery to me, and I've done everything to avoid it. However, this weekend, I've made the decision to dive in and learn it.

What on earth is AWK?

AWK, a specialized language designed for text processing, is frequently utilized for tasks such as data extraction and report generation. Comparable to tools like `sed` and `grep`, AWK functions as a filter and is included as a standard component in many Unix-like operating systems.

Although it is an established and fully featured programming language, in today's landscape, there exist multiple more advanced alternatives to AWK, making it primarily sought after for processing columnar data. However, if you frequently find yourself navigating through extensive datasets, AWK remains a valuable choice, capable of delivering efficient solutions with just a single line of command.

# Source data

This is the columnar data on which we will run awk commands.

| FirstName      | LastName       |    Age	 |        Location	      |       KilledBy                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

Write this data to a separate file, which can be named data.txt.

# Command Structure

This the basic structure of and awk command:-  

```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN{code}/regex pattern/{action}END{code}' your_file_name.txt
```

> The BEGIN and END sections only run once, while the middle section runs once for each line in the file.

Lets Start 


```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN{printf "This is the start of data\n"} {print $0} END{printf "This is end of data\n"}' data.txt
```

> In the BEGIN and END sections, the print command runs only once, while print $0 prints every line
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/1.png)


```awk:awk
awk '{print $0}' data.txt
```

> We can use any of the three sections individually. In this example, we only use the middle one to print everything as is.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/2.png)

# Build-In Variables

```awk:awk
awk '{print NR,$0}' data.txt
```
> It represents the number of the current record. For example, in the above command, it prints the line number along with the data.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/3.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print NR "-" $1}' data.txt
```

> We can interpolate the print statement to change the output as we desire.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/4.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'NR==2, NR==4 {print NR,$0}' data.txt 
```
> NR can also be used to print a particular line or lines.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/5.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print $NF}' data.txt
```

>It is a predefined variable whose value is the number of fields in the current record. Here, it prints the last column.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/6.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print FS}' data.txt
```
> It represents the input field separator, with its default value being space. You can also change this by using the -F command line option.

```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN {print "Arguments =", ARGC}' One Two Three Four
```

> ARGC represents the argument count.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/7.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN {print ARGV[0],ARGV[1],ARGV[3]}' one two three
```

>ARGV is an array of command line arguments.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/8.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN { print ENVIRON["USER"] }'
```
>It is an array of environment variables.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/9.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'END {print FILENAME}' data.txt
``` 
>It represents the current file name.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/10.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN { if (match("One Two Three", "re")) { print RLENGTH } }'
```

>Match is a predefined function that searches for a given string in the input string, and RLENGTH stores the length of the search string or pattern.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/11.png)

# Common Usage

```awk:awk
awk '{print $1}' data.txt
```
> We can choose which column to display with `$1`, `$2`, and so on. If no delimiter is provided, it will use space by default.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/12.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print $3}' data.txt
```
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/13.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print $1 "\t" $3}' data.txt
```
>We can do interpolation to make the output prettier.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/14.png)

```awk:awk
awk '{print $1}' data.txt | head -2
```

>The result of an awk command can be piped into other commands to create complex logic.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/15.png)

```awk:awk
awk '/^O/' data.txt
```
> Regular expressions can be added between slashes (/), and each line will get matched with it. The caret (^) is used to match the starting letter in any line.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/16.png)

```awk:awk
awk '/n$/' data.txt
```

>"$" is used to match the ending letter in any line.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/17.png)

```awk:awk
awk '! /n$/' data.txt
```
> "!" is the negation (opposite) of any match.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/18.png)


```awk:awk
awk '/Landing/{print $1, $3}' data.txt
``` 

> Data that is matched with the regular expression is further manipulated and displayed with a print block.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/19.png)

```awk:awk
awk -f  awk-src.txt data.txt 
```

```awk:awk-src.txt
$3 > 30 { print $0 }
```

> AWK is a programming language. We have been using its ad-hoc style commands for text manipulation, but for bigger, multiline logics, we can store the code in a separate file and pass that file with the -f parameter.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/20.png)

```awk:awk
awk 'length($0) > 100' data.txt
```
> Length is a predefined function that gives the length of data, and we can apply conditionals to it. In the above example, lines having more than 100 characters get printed.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/21.png)


```awk:awk
awk '{ if (length($0) > max) max = length($0) } END { print max }' data.txt
```
> We can also use full-fledged conditional logic with 'if' here. In the above example, the 'if' block will run for every line to get the maximum length, and the 'END' block will only run once at the end to print the maximum value.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/22.png)


```awk:awk
awk '{ if($2 == "Baratheon") print $0;}' data.txt
```
>With this trick, we can also find particular data in a specific column and print those rows.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/23.png)


```awk:awk
awk 'BEGIN { for(i=1;i<=6;i++) print "square of", i, "is",i*i; }'
```
>AWK also provides us with looping capabilities.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/24.png)


```awk:awk
awk -v name=Barry 'BEGIN{printf "Name = %s\n", name}'
```
> We can also pass variables from the outside execution environment into the AWK command. For example, if we run AWK through a shell script.
![1](/static/images/blog/awk-guide/25.png)

```awk:awk
awk -f  sum.txt 2 5
```

```txt:sum.txt
function sum(n1, n2) {
    res = n1 + n2
    print "Sum =", res
}

BEGIN {
   sum(ARGV[1], ARGV[2])
}
```

> We can pass arguments into AWK code. Here, we have a function to print the sum of two numbers called from the BEGIN section. We pass 2 and 4 into the AWK code and perform their sum.
