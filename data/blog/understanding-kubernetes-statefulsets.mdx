# Introduction

**Kubernetes** is a powerful container orchestration platform designed for deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. 

While **Deployments**  are commonly used for stateless applications, there are scenarios where the state of an application must be preserved. Enter **StatefulSets**, a specialized Kubernetes resource designed for managing **stateful applications**. 

This blog explores StatefulSets in detail, including use cases, and how to implement them.

# What Are StatefulSets?

A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes workload API object used to manage stateful applications. Unlike **Deployments**, which treat Pods as interchangeable, StatefulSets provide:

- **Stable Network Identity**

  Each Pod in a StatefulSet gets a DNS name in the format:
  ```
  <pod-name>.<service-name>
  ```
  **For example,** if a StatefulSet is named `my-db` and is associated with a headless service `my-db-service`, the Pods will have DNS names like:

  - `my-db-0.my-db-service`
  - `my-db-1.my-db-service`

  This is critical for stateful applications, such as databases, where Pods must refer to each other reliably.

- **Persistent Storage**

  StatefulSets use **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)** to provision storage for each Pod. Unlike Deployments, where storage is ephemeral and shared, each Pod in a StatefulSet gets its **own dedicated volume**, ensuring that the data persists across Pod restarts or rescheduling.

- **Ordered Deployment and Scaling**

  - **Creation**: Pods are created sequentially, one at a time (e.g., `my-db-0`, then `my-db-1`).
  - **Termination**: Pods are terminated in reverse order (e.g., `my-db-2`, then `my-db-1`).
  - **Updates**: StatefulSets update Pods in a rolling fashion, ensuring that at most one Pod is unavailable during an update.

# Headless service 

A **headless service in Kubernetes** is a service that does not create a **cluster IP**, meaning it doesn't have a single IP address that clients can use to access it. Instead, the service exposes the individual IPs of the pods directly. 

To create a headless service, you can set the `clusterIP: None` in the service definition.

DNS resolution for a headless service in Kubernetes works differently than for a standard service. 

Here's how it works:
  - **DNS Query**

    When a pod makes a DNS query for the headless service (e.g., my-headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local), Kubernetes doesn't return a single IP address. Instead, it **returns a list of IP addresses**, each corresponding to the individual pods that are part of the service.

  - **Resolution Behavior**

    - For a **standard service**, DNS returns a single IP (the ClusterIP) for load balancing.
    - For a **headless service**, DNS resolution returns multiple pod IPs, typically as **A records or SRV records**, which allows direct access to individual pods.

# Let's get our hands dirty

>All commands are executed on a Kubernetes cluster deployed locally using Minikube.

- **Create a Deployment**

  Deploy Nginx as a Deployment, just for comparison.

  ```yaml:deployment.yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx-deploy
  spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-deploy
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-deploy
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
    ```           
  ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p2.png)
  > We can see that the pod gets random alphanumeric characters attached to its name, and these are ephemeral.

- **Create a Persistent Volume**

  This Persistent Volume (PV) is created using the host filesystem. Generally, a cloud provider is used to create volumes in production environments.

  ```yaml:pv.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: PersistentVolume
  metadata:
    name: nginx-pv
  spec:
    capacity:
      storage: 1Gi
    volumeMode: Filesystem
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
    storageClassName: manual
    hostPath:
      path: /tmp/nginx-data
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
  ```
  ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p1.png)


- **Create a StatefulSet**

    This is a StatefulSet YAML file, which differs slightly from a Deployment YAML file:

      - **spec.serviceName:** Specifies the name of the headless service used for pod DNS address resolution.
      - **volumeClaimTemplates:** A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is created to claim storage from a PersistentVolume (PV) for each pod.
      
    **initContainers:** Although not specific to StatefulSets, it is used in this case to create a custom HTML index page that returns the hostname.

    ```yaml:sts.yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: StatefulSet
    metadata:
      name: nginx-stateful
    spec:
      serviceName: "nginx-service-hl"
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx-stateful
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx-stateful
        spec:
          initContainers:
          - name: setup
            image: busybox:1.28  
            command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo '<h1>Hello !! </h1>I am loaded from <b>nginx-pvc</b> <br>Pod name: <b>\'$HOSTNAME\'' > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html && echo 'done' && exit "]  
            volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
              name: nginx-data
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
            volumeMounts:
            - name: nginx-data
              mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html  # Mount same volume to nginx container

      volumeClaimTemplates:
      - metadata:
          name: nginx-data
        spec:
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 1Gi

    ```

   >Each of the three pods gets two PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) attached, enabling them to use storage from the PersistentVolumes (PVs).

- Now, let's explore and discover some key properties of StatefulSets in practice:

  - **Unique ordinal index**

    The three pods from the StatefulSet have names with **random strings attached, but their identity is stable and defined**. In contrast, pods created by a Deployment are **truly ephemeral, with random strings in their names**.

    If I delete one pod from the StatefulSet and one from the Deployment, a new pod will be created for the Deployment, but for the StatefulSet, a pod with the same name and the same PVC will be created, **ensuring persistence**.

    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p4.png)

  - **Stable Network Identity**

    To access Nginx, whether deployed as a Deployment or a StatefulSet, we need a service.

    For the Deployment, we create a service of type ClusterIP, which will load balance traffic across multiple pods.

    ```yaml:deployment-svc.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service-d
      labels:
        app: nginx-deploy
    spec:
      selector:
        app: nginx-deploy # Matches the labels of the Nginx Pods in the Deployment
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80         # Port on the Service
          targetPort: 80   # Port on the Nginx Pods
      type: ClusterIP
    ```
    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p5.png)
    >We can access the nginx deployment using the cluster IP as should in image and the name for service as a DNS address.

    Let's try to connect to it. I will be using an image I built that contains all the necessary networking tools to curl the Nginx Deployment's service.
    [Check this blog to learn more](https://www.amitbrewscode.in/blog/networking-tools-unpacked-linux-edition)

    ```bash
    kubectl run busybox --image=amit0myth/networking-toolset:v2 --restart=Never --rm -it -- sh
    ```

    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p6.png)
    >As we can see, I can curl the Nginx Deployment using its IP, the service name, and the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), which is resolved using the CoreDNS service.

    In the case of a StatefulSet, we create a headless service.
    ```yaml:headless-svc.yaml
        apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx-service-hl
      labels:
        app: nginx-service-hl
    spec:
      clusterIP: None # this will result in a headless service
      selector:
        app: nginx-stateful
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    ```
    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p7.png)
    > service nginx-service-hl has no IP 

    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p8.png)
    >The service name resolves to three IPs, each assigned to a pod. We can either call the service, and traffic will be load-balanced across the pods, or we can directly call individual pods using their respective pod names.

  - **Scaling **

    The StatefulSet controller creates each pod sequentially based on its ordinal index, ensuring that each pod's predecessor is Running and Ready before launching the next pod.

    ```bash 
    kubectl scale sts nginx-stateful --replicas=5
    ```
    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p9.png)
    >When scaling up a StatefulSet, the control plane creates new pods in sequential order, starting with the next available ordinal index, and ensures that each new pod is Running and Ready before creating the next one.


    ```bash
    # This will perform instant downscale, without taking into account the ordinal index sequence.
    kubectl scale sts nginx-stateful --replicas=2 => instant scale down 
    ```

    ```bash 
    kubectl patch sts nginx-stateful -p '{"spec":{"replicas":2}}
    ```
    ![pv](/static/images/blog/understanding-kubernetes-statefulsets/p10.png)
        >The control plane deletes one pod at a time, in reverse order of its ordinal index, and waits for each pod to be fully shut down before deleting the next one.
