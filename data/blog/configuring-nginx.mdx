# Introduction

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) is a powerful web server and reverse proxy known for its **speed, scalability, and ease of configuration**. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore various configurations from basic setups to advanced use cases, with detailed explanations of each configuration file.

When working with NGINX configuration files, you'll encounter two essential concepts: **directives** and **contexts**. These form the backbone of how NGINX processes its configurations.

- **Directives:**

    In an NGINX configuration file, every instruction is referred to as a directive. There are two types of directives:

    - **Simple Directives:**

        These consist of a directive name followed by parameters separated by spaces. Each simple directive ends with a semicolon (;). Examples include directives like `listen`, `server_name`, and `return`.

        Example:
        ```
        listen 80;
        return 404;
        ```

    - **Block Directives:**

        Block directives are similar to simple directives but, instead of ending with a semicolon, they use curly braces ({ }) to group additional instructions or nested directives.

        Example:
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
        }
        ```
- **Contexts:**

    Block directives that can contain other directives inside them are referred to as **contexts**. NGINX has several key contexts that dictate how its configurations are structured:

    - **Main Context:**

        The main context is the outermost level of the configuration file. Any directive defined outside of the events or http contexts belongs to the main context.

    - **Events Context:**

        The events context is used to define global settings related to how NGINX handles incoming client connections.

        **Example:**
        ```
        events {
            worker_connections 1024;
        }
        ```
    - **HTTP Context:**

        The http context specifies settings for handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It acts as the parent for other contexts like server and location.

        **Example:**
        ```
        http {
            include mime.types;
            default_type application/octet-stream;
        }
        ```
    - **Server Context:**

        Nested inside the http context, the server context allows you to define settings for individual virtual servers (e.g., different websites or domains).

        **Example:**
        ```
        http {
            server {
                listen 80;
                server_name example.com;
            }

            server {
                listen 443 ssl;
                server_name secure.example.com;
            }
        }
        ```

**Note:**

    Since we don't own the domain being used and are only using it for learning purposes, we will update the hosts file to map the domain (e.g., mothership.io) to localhost.

        - **Steps:**
            - **Locate the hosts file**
                On Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
            - **Add the following entry to the file:**

                ```plaintext
                127.0.0.1 mothership.io
                ```
            - **Running Examples:**
                The examples are designed to work with Docker Compose. To get started, simply run the following command:

                ```bash
                docker compose up
                ```
            - **Familiarity with Docker Compose is a prerequisite. For more details, refer to [this blog](https://amitbrewscode.in/blog/docker-compose-makes-life-easier).**

# Basic config

    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
    services:
    nginx:
        image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
        container_name: nginx
        volumes:
        - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
        ports:
        - "80:80"
        networks:
        - app-network

    networks:
    app-network:
        driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf
    events {}

    http {
        server {

            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            return 200 "Hello world\n";
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration creates a server that listens on **port 80** for requests to **mothership.io** and always responds with "Hello world\n" and an HTTP 200 status code:
        - **events {}:** A required block for Nginx to start, even if empty. It handles connection processing settings but isn't used here.
        - **http {}:** Defines the HTTP server configuration.
        - **server {}:** Defines an individual server block (virtual host).
        - **listen 80:** Configures the server to listen for requests on port 80 (HTTP).
        - **server_name mothership.io:** Specifies the domain name this server will respond to.
        - **return 200 "Hello world\n":** Returns a plain-text response "Hello world\n" with an HTTP 200 status code for all requests.

# Multiple virtual servers

    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
    services:
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "3000:3000"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf
    events {}

    http {
        server {
            listen 3000;
            server_name mothership.io;
            return 200 "Hello world from port 3000\n";
        }

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
            return 200 "Hello world from port 80\n";
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up two servers for the same domain (mothership.io) but on different ports:
        
        - **First server block:**
            - **listen 3000:** Listens for requests on port 3000.
            - **server_name mothership.io:** Responds to requests for mothership.io.
            - **return 200 "Hello world from port 3000\n":** Always responds with "Hello world from port 3000\n" and an HTTP 200 status code.
        
        - **Second server block:**
            - **listen 80:** Listens for requests on port 80 (default HTTP port).
            - **server_name mothership.io:** Also responds to requests for mothership.io.
            - **return 200 "Hello world from port 80\n":** Always responds with "Hello world from port 80\n" and an HTTP 200 status code.

# Serve static content
    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml 
    services:
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app:/srv/app:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
            root /srv/app;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a simple HTTP server with additional MIME type handling and file serving (index.html):

            - **include /etc/nginx/mime.types:** Includes MIME type mappings from the specified file to ensure proper handling of file types (e.g., serving .html as text/html).
            - **root /srv/app:** Sets the root directory for serving files. Files will be served from **/srv/app** when requested.

    **Output**:
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p4.png)

# Locations
    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            root /srv/app;

            location /info {
                return 200 "Info content";
            }

            location = /help {
                return 200 "Help content";
            }

            location ~ /customer[0-9] {
                return 200 "Customer content";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a server with custom routes that respond differently based on the request path:
            - **location /info {}:** Returns "Info content" for requests to `/info`.this will also satisfy `/infozone` or any string having info as prefix
            - **location = /help {}:** Matches exactly /help and returns "Help content".
            - **location ~ /customer[0-9] {}:** Uses a regular expression to match URLs like `/customer1`, `/customer2`, etc., and returns "Customer content".

    **Output:**
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p5.png)
        > content served at /info

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p6.png)
        > content served at /infozone as it has info as prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p7.png)
        > content not served at /2infozone as it does not have info as prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p8.png)
        > content served at /help

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p9.png)
        > content not served at /helpp as it need exact match with string help, not a prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p10.png)
        >content served at customer1 as the regex(have a number at end of path) is satisfied

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p11.png)
        >content not served at customer1 as the regex is not satisfied


# Rewrites and Redirects

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            root /srv/app;

            location /info {
                return 307 /index.html;
            }

            rewrite /help /index.html;
        }

    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This configuration serves files from `/srv/app`, temporarily redirects `/info` to `/index.html`, and internally rewrites `/help` to `/index.html`.

            - **location /info {}:** Redirects requests to `/info` to `/index.html` using a **307 Temporary Redirect**.
            - **rewrite /help /index.html:** Internally rewrites requests to `/help` so they are handled as `/index.html` without changing the URL visible to the client.

    **Output:**
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p12.png)
        >We can see a 307 status code in network request

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p13.png)
        >We can see the url is /help but content is from index

# Reverse proxy
    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml 
    services:
        app1:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: app1
            volumes:
            - ./app1/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app1:/srv/app:ro
            networks:
            - app-network
        app2:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: app2
            volumes:
            - ./app2/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app2:/srv/app:ro
            networks:
            - app-network
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
        
            location /app1 {
                    proxy_pass http://app1;          
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;      
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

                    rewrite ^/app1/(.*)$ /$1 break;
            }

            location /app2 {
                    proxy_pass http://app2;         
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;       
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 

                    rewrite ^/app2/(.*)$ /$1 break;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a reverse proxy that routes traffic to two backend services **(app1 and app2)** based on the request path.

            - **location /app1 {}:**
                - **proxy_pass http://app1:** Forwards requests starting with /app1 to the backend server app1.
                - **proxy_set_header:**
                    - **Host $host:** Passes the original Host header to the backend.
                    - **X-Real-IP $remote_addr:** Adds the clientâ€™s IP address in the  `X-Real-IP` header for the backend.
                - **rewrite ^/app1/(.*)$ /$1 break:** Strips `/app1` from the request path before passing it to the backend.
            - **location /app2 {}:**
                - **proxy_pass http://app2;: Forwards requests starting with /app2 to the backend server app2.
                - **rewrite ^/app2/(.*)$ /$1 break:** Strips `/app2` from the request path before passing it to the backend.

# Load Balancing

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            location / {
                    proxy_pass http://backend;
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            }
        }

        upstream backend {
            server app1:80;       # Backend server 1
            server app2:80;       # Backend server 2
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This configuration sets up an Nginx server to proxy requests for mothership.io to a load-balanced group of two backend servers **(app1 and app2)**.
            - **proxy_pass http://backend:** Forwards requests to the backend upstream group.
            - **proxy_set_header Host $host:** Sets the Host header in the forwarded request to the client's original Host.
            - **proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr:** Adds the client's IP address to the X-Real-IP header for backend servers.
            - **upstream backend {}:** Defines a load-balanced group of backend servers:
                - **server app1:80:** Specifies app1 as a backend server on port 80.
                - **server app2:80:** Specifies app2 as a backend server on port 80.

# Rate Limiting

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;

        server {
            location /login {
                limit_req zone=one burst=5 nodelay;

                return 200 "Hello world\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This configuration limits requests to **/login to 10 requests per second per client IP**, allowing up to **5 extra burst requests**, and returns "Hello world" for requests that are within the rate limit.
        - **limit_req_zone:** Defines a shared memory zone for rate limiting.
            - **$binary_remote_addr:** Uses the client's IP address as the key for rate limiting.
            - **zone=one:10m:** Allocates a 10MB memory zone named one for storing rate-limiting data.
            - **rate=10r/s:** Allows up to 10 requests per second per client IP.
        - **location /login {}:**
            - **limit_req:** Applies the rate-limiting rule:
                - **zone=one:** Uses the one rate-limiting zone.
                - **burst=5:** Allows up to 5 extra requests in a burst.
                - **nodelay:** No delay for burst requests, they are processed immediately.
            - **return 200 "Hello world\n":** Responds with a status code 200 and the text "Hello world" when the rate limit is respected.

    **Behavior:**
        - Requests to /login are limited to 10 requests per second per client IP.
        - Clients can burst up to 5 extra requests beyond the rate limit without delay.
        - If the rate limit or burst allowance is exceeded, requests are rejected with an HTTP 503 status code.
        - A successful request within the limits responds with "Hello world\n".

# Monitoring

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        server {
            location /nginx_status {
                stub_status; # Enables Nginx status metrics
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration enables a status endpoint that provides basic metrics about the server's performance and connections.

            - **stub_status:** Activates the Nginx stub status module to provide real-time metrics about the server.

    **Behavior:**
    
        When a client accesses `/nginx_status`, Nginx returns plain-text metrics such as:
            - **Active connections:** Number of current client connections.
            - **Accepted connections and handled requests:** Totals since the server started.
            - **Reading:** Connections reading client requests.
            - **Writing:** Connections writing responses.
            - **Waiting:** Idle connections in the keep-alive state.

13. Performance optimization

    - **Worker Processes and Connections**
        
        Nginx is designed to handle thousands of connections efficiently. To optimize its performance, configure the number of worker processes and connections based on your server's resources.

        ```nginx
        worker_processes auto;               # Ensures Nginx uses all available CPU cores.
        worker_connections 1024;             # Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections per worker process.
        events {
            use epoll;                       # Use efficient event model (Linux-specific)
            multi_accept on;                 # Allows workers to accept multiple connections simultaneously.
        }
        ``` 

    - **Gzip Compression**
        
        Enabling Gzip reduces bandwidth usage by compressing responses before sending them to clients.

        ```nginx 
            gzip on;                            # Enables Gzip compression.
            gzip_types text/plain text/css;     # Specifies MIME types to compress.
            gzip_min_length 1024;               # Only compress responses larger than 1KB.
            gzip_vary on;                       # Ensures proxies cache compressed and uncompressed versions separately.
            gzip_proxied any;                   # Enable compression for proxied requests
        ```

    - **Cache Static Files**
        
        Serving static files from cache improves response times and reduces load on the backend.
        ```nginx 
        location /static/ {
            root /var/www/example;
            expires max;                                    # Caches static files for as long as possible.
            add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";   # Enhances caching by marking files as immutable unless theyâ€™re updated.
        }
        ```


    - **Limit Request Buffer Size**
        
        Reducing buffer sizes prevents excessive memory usage and protects against potential denial-of-service attacks.

        ```nginx
        client_max_body_size 10M;           # Sets the maximum size of uploaded files.
        client_body_buffer_size 128k;       # Allocates memory for buffering request bodies.
        client_header_buffer_size 1k;       # Buffer size for request headers
        large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;   # Defines buffers for requests with large headers.
        ```

    - **Connection Timeout**
        
        Fine-tuning timeouts ensures the server doesnâ€™t waste resources on slow clients.

        ```nginx 
            keepalive_timeout 15;               # Controls how long a connection remains open after a request.
            send_timeout 10;                    # Sets the timeout for transmitting responses to clients.
            client_header_timeout 10;           # Timeout for reading client headers
            client_body_timeout 10;             # Timeout for reading client request body
        ```
    - **Enable HTTP/2**
            
            HTTP/2 improves performance by multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection.

            ```nginx
                server {
                    listen 443 ssl http2;   # Enables HTTP/2 for faster connection reuse and lower latency.
                    .
                    .
                    .
                }
            ```
            http2: Enables HTTP/2 for faster connection reuse and lower latency.
