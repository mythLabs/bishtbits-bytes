# Introduction

[Nginx](https://nginx.org/) is a powerful web server and reverse proxy known for its **speed, scalability, and ease of configuration**. In this guide, we’ll explore various configurations from basic setups to advanced use cases, with detailed explanations of each configuration file.

When working with NGINX configuration files, you'll encounter two essential concepts: **directives** and **contexts**. These form the backbone of how NGINX processes its configurations.

- **Directives:**

    In an NGINX configuration file, every instruction is referred to as a directive. There are two types of directives:

    - **Simple Directives:**

        These consist of a directive name followed by parameters separated by spaces. Each simple directive ends with a semicolon (;). Examples include directives like `listen`, `server_name`, and `return`.

        Example:
        ```
        listen 80;
        return 404;
        ```

    - **Block Directives:**

        Block directives are similar to simple directives but, instead of ending with a semicolon, they use curly braces ({ }) to group additional instructions or nested directives.

        Example:
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name example.com;
        }
        ```
- **Contexts:**

    Block directives that can contain other directives inside them are referred to as **contexts**. NGINX has several key contexts that dictate how its configurations are structured:

    - **Main Context:**

        The main context is the outermost level of the configuration file. Any directive defined outside of the events or http contexts belongs to the main context.

    - **Events Context:**

        The events context is used to define global settings related to how NGINX handles incoming client connections.

        **Example:**
        ```
        events {
            worker_connections 1024;
        }
        ```
    - **HTTP Context:**

        The http context specifies settings for handling HTTP and HTTPS traffic. It acts as the parent for other contexts like server and location.

        **Example:**
        ```
        http {
            include mime.types;
            default_type application/octet-stream;
        }
        ```
    - **Server Context:**

        Nested inside the http context, the server context allows you to define settings for individual virtual servers (e.g., different websites or domains).

        **Example:**
        ```
        http {
            server {
                listen 80;
                server_name example.com;
            }

            server {
                listen 443 ssl;
                server_name secure.example.com;
            }
        }
        ```

**Note:**

    Since we don't own the domain being used and are only using it for learning purposes, we will update the hosts file to map the domain (e.g., mothership.io) to localhost.

        - **Steps:**
            - **Locate the hosts file**
                On Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`
            - **Add the following entry to the file:**

                ```plaintext
                127.0.0.1 mothership.io
                ```
            - **Running Examples:**
                The examples are designed to work with Docker Compose. To get started, simply run the following command:

                ```bash
                docker compose up
                ```
            - **Familiarity with Docker Compose is a prerequisite. For more details, refer to [this blog](https://amitbrewscode.in/blog/docker-compose-makes-life-easier).**

# Basic config

    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
    services:
    nginx:
        image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
        container_name: nginx
        volumes:
        - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
        ports:
        - "80:80"
        networks:
        - app-network

    networks:
    app-network:
        driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf
    events {}

    http {
        server {

            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            return 200 "Hello world\n";
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration creates a server that listens on **port 80** for requests to **mothership.io** and always responds with "Hello world\n" and an HTTP 200 status code:
        - **events {}:** A required block for Nginx to start, even if empty. It handles connection processing settings but isn't used here.
        - **http {}:** Defines the HTTP server configuration.
        - **server {}:** Defines an individual server block (virtual host).
        - **listen 80:** Configures the server to listen for requests on port 80 (HTTP).
        - **server_name mothership.io:** Specifies the domain name this server will respond to.
        - **return 200 "Hello world\n":** Returns a plain-text response "Hello world\n" with an HTTP 200 status code for all requests.

# Multiple virtual servers

    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml
    services:
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            - "3000:3000"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf
    events {}

    http {
        server {
            listen 3000;
            server_name mothership.io;
            return 200 "Hello world from port 3000\n";
        }

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
            return 200 "Hello world from port 80\n";
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up two servers for the same domain (mothership.io) but on different ports:
        
        - **First server block:**
            - **listen 3000:** Listens for requests on port 3000.
            - **server_name mothership.io:** Responds to requests for mothership.io.
            - **return 200 "Hello world from port 3000\n":** Always responds with "Hello world from port 3000\n" and an HTTP 200 status code.
        
        - **Second server block:**
            - **listen 80:** Listens for requests on port 80 (default HTTP port).
            - **server_name mothership.io:** Also responds to requests for mothership.io.
            - **return 200 "Hello world from port 80\n":** Always responds with "Hello world from port 80\n" and an HTTP 200 status code.

# Serve static content
    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml 
    services:
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app:/srv/app:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
            root /srv/app;
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a simple HTTP server with additional MIME type handling and file serving (index.html):

            - **include /etc/nginx/mime.types:** Includes MIME type mappings from the specified file to ensure proper handling of file types (e.g., serving .html as text/html).
            - **root /srv/app:** Sets the root directory for serving files. Files will be served from **/srv/app** when requested.

    **Output**:
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p4.png)

# Locations
    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {

        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            root /srv/app;

            location /info {
                return 200 "Info content";
            }

            location = /help {
                return 200 "Help content";
            }

            location ~ /customer[0-9] {
                return 200 "Customer content";
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a server with custom routes that respond differently based on the request path:
            - **location /info {}:** Returns "Info content" for requests to `/info`.this will also satisfy `/infozone` or any string having info as prefix
            - **location = /help {}:** Matches exactly /help and returns "Help content".
            - **location ~ /customer[0-9] {}:** Uses a regular expression to match URLs like `/customer1`, `/customer2`, etc., and returns "Customer content".

    **Output:**
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p5.png)
        > content served at /info

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p6.png)
        > content served at /infozone as it has info as prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p7.png)
        > content not served at /2infozone as it does not have info as prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p8.png)
        > content served at /help

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p9.png)
        > content not served at /helpp as it need exact match with string help, not a prefix

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p10.png)
        >content served at customer1 as the regex(have a number at end of path) is satisfied

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p11.png)
        >content not served at customer1 as the regex is not satisfied


# Rewrites and Redirects

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            root /srv/app;

            location /info {
                return 307 /index.html;
            }

            rewrite /help /index.html;
        }

    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This configuration serves files from `/srv/app`, temporarily redirects `/info` to `/index.html`, and internally rewrites `/help` to `/index.html`.

            - **location /info {}:** Redirects requests to `/info` to `/index.html` using a **307 Temporary Redirect**.
            - **rewrite /help /index.html:** Internally rewrites requests to `/help` so they are handled as `/index.html` without changing the URL visible to the client.

    **Output:**
        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p12.png)
        >We can see a 307 status code in network request

        ![basic](/static/images/blog/configuring-nginx/p13.png)
        >We can see the url is /help but content is from index

# Reverse proxy
    ```yaml:docker-compose.yaml 
    services:
        app1:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: app1
            volumes:
            - ./app1/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app1:/srv/app:ro
            networks:
            - app-network
        app2:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: app2
            volumes:
            - ./app2/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            - ./app2:/srv/app:ro
            networks:
            - app-network
        nginx:
            image: "nginx:1.27.1-alpine-slim"
            container_name: nginx
            volumes:
            - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
            ports:
            - "80:80"
            networks:
            - app-network

    networks:
        app-network:
            driver: bridge
    ```

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;
        
            location /app1 {
                    proxy_pass http://app1;          
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;      
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

                    rewrite ^/app1/(.*)$ /$1 break;
            }

            location /app2 {
                    proxy_pass http://app2;         
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;       
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; 

                    rewrite ^/app2/(.*)$ /$1 break;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration sets up a reverse proxy that routes traffic to two backend services **(app1 and app2)** based on the request path.

            - **location /app1 {}:**
                - **proxy_pass http://app1:** Forwards requests starting with /app1 to the backend server app1.
                - **proxy_set_header:**
                    - **Host $host:** Passes the original Host header to the backend.
                    - **X-Real-IP $remote_addr:** Adds the client’s IP address in the  `X-Real-IP` header for the backend.
                - **rewrite ^/app1/(.*)$ /$1 break:** Strips `/app1` from the request path before passing it to the backend.
            - **location /app2 {}:**
                - **proxy_pass http://app2;: Forwards requests starting with /app2 to the backend server app2.
                - **rewrite ^/app2/(.*)$ /$1 break:** Strips `/app2` from the request path before passing it to the backend.

# Load Balancing

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name mothership.io;

            location / {
                    proxy_pass http://backend;
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            }
        }

        upstream backend {
            server app1:80;       # Backend server 1
            server app2:80;       # Backend server 2
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This configuration sets up an Nginx server to proxy requests for mothership.io to a load-balanced group of two backend servers **(app1 and app2)**.
            - **proxy_pass http://backend:** Forwards requests to the backend upstream group.
            - **proxy_set_header Host $host:** Sets the Host header in the forwarded request to the client's original Host.
            - **proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr:** Adds the client's IP address to the X-Real-IP header for backend servers.
            - **upstream backend {}:** Defines a load-balanced group of backend servers:
                - **server app1:80:** Specifies app1 as a backend server on port 80.
                - **server app2:80:** Specifies app2 as a backend server on port 80.

# Rate Limiting

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;

        server {
            location /login {
                limit_req zone=one burst=5 nodelay;

                return 200 "Hello world\n";
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    **Config explained:**

        This configuration limits requests to **/login to 10 requests per second per client IP**, allowing up to **5 extra burst requests**, and returns "Hello world" for requests that are within the rate limit.
        - **limit_req_zone:** Defines a shared memory zone for rate limiting.
            - **$binary_remote_addr:** Uses the client's IP address as the key for rate limiting.
            - **zone=one:10m:** Allocates a 10MB memory zone named one for storing rate-limiting data.
            - **rate=10r/s:** Allows up to 10 requests per second per client IP.
        - **location /login {}:**
            - **limit_req:** Applies the rate-limiting rule:
                - **zone=one:** Uses the one rate-limiting zone.
                - **burst=5:** Allows up to 5 extra requests in a burst.
                - **nodelay:** No delay for burst requests, they are processed immediately.
            - **return 200 "Hello world\n":** Responds with a status code 200 and the text "Hello world" when the rate limit is respected.

    **Behavior:**
        - Requests to /login are limited to 10 requests per second per client IP.
        - Clients can burst up to 5 extra requests beyond the rate limit without delay.
        - If the rate limit or burst allowance is exceeded, requests are rejected with an HTTP 503 status code.
        - A successful request within the limits responds with "Hello world\n".

# Monitoring

    ```nginx:nginx.conf 
    events {}

    http {
        server {
            location /nginx_status {
                stub_status; # Enables Nginx status metrics
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Config explained:**

        This Nginx configuration enables a status endpoint that provides basic metrics about the server's performance and connections.

            - **stub_status:** Activates the Nginx stub status module to provide real-time metrics about the server.

    **Behavior:**
    
        When a client accesses `/nginx_status`, Nginx returns plain-text metrics such as:
            - **Active connections:** Number of current client connections.
            - **Accepted connections and handled requests:** Totals since the server started.
            - **Reading:** Connections reading client requests.
            - **Writing:** Connections writing responses.
            - **Waiting:** Idle connections in the keep-alive state.

13. Performance optimization

    - **Worker Processes and Connections**
        
        Nginx is designed to handle thousands of connections efficiently. To optimize its performance, configure the number of worker processes and connections based on your server's resources.

        ```nginx
        worker_processes auto;               # Ensures Nginx uses all available CPU cores.
        worker_connections 1024;             # Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections per worker process.
        events {
            use epoll;                       # Use efficient event model (Linux-specific)
            multi_accept on;                 # Allows workers to accept multiple connections simultaneously.
        }
        ``` 

    - **Gzip Compression**
        
        Enabling Gzip reduces bandwidth usage by compressing responses before sending them to clients.

        ```nginx 
            gzip on;                            # Enables Gzip compression.
            gzip_types text/plain text/css;     # Specifies MIME types to compress.
            gzip_min_length 1024;               # Only compress responses larger than 1KB.
            gzip_vary on;                       # Ensures proxies cache compressed and uncompressed versions separately.
            gzip_proxied any;                   # Enable compression for proxied requests
        ```

    - **Cache Static Files**
        
        Serving static files from cache improves response times and reduces load on the backend.
        ```nginx 
        location /static/ {
            root /var/www/example;
            expires max;                                    # Caches static files for as long as possible.
            add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";   # Enhances caching by marking files as immutable unless they’re updated.
        }
        ```


    - **Limit Request Buffer Size**
        
        Reducing buffer sizes prevents excessive memory usage and protects against potential denial-of-service attacks.

        ```nginx
        client_max_body_size 10M;           # Sets the maximum size of uploaded files.
        client_body_buffer_size 128k;       # Allocates memory for buffering request bodies.
        client_header_buffer_size 1k;       # Buffer size for request headers
        large_client_header_buffers 4 8k;   # Defines buffers for requests with large headers.
        ```

    - **Connection Timeout**
        
        Fine-tuning timeouts ensures the server doesn’t waste resources on slow clients.

        ```nginx 
            keepalive_timeout 15;               # Controls how long a connection remains open after a request.
            send_timeout 10;                    # Sets the timeout for transmitting responses to clients.
            client_header_timeout 10;           # Timeout for reading client headers
            client_body_timeout 10;             # Timeout for reading client request body
        ```
    - **Enable HTTP/2**
            
            HTTP/2 improves performance by multiplexing multiple requests over a single connection.

            ```nginx
                server {
                    listen 443 ssl http2;   # Enables HTTP/2 for faster connection reuse and lower latency.
                    .
                    .
                    .
                }
            ```
            http2: Enables HTTP/2 for faster connection reuse and lower latency.
