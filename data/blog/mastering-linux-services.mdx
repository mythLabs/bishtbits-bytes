# Introduction
**Linux services**, often referred to as `daemons`, are background processes that run independently to perform essential tasks, such as managing hardware or handling network requests. 

Traditionally managed with **init scripts**, many modern distributions use `systemd`, which provides a flexible framework for service management through unit files.
We will be using `systemd`.

Services can operate in various states `(active, inactive, or failed)` and can be configured with resource limits and dependencies.

# Creating a basic service

  - Create a custom shell script that will be run as a service.
  ```shell:log_message.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  while true; do
      echo "Hello from the custom service! at $(date)" >> /home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.log
      sleep 10  # Wait for 10 seconds
  done
  ```
 - Make the file executable.
    ```shell
      # Grants execute permissions to the /log_message.sh script.
      sudo chmod +x /log_message.sh
    ```

 - Create the systemd service file.
      ```shell 
      sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/custom_logger.service
      ```

      ```shell:custom_logger.service
      [Unit]
      Description=Custom Shell Logger Service

      [Service]
      ExecStart=/home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.sh
      User=amit

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
      ```

      ![service file created](/static/images/blog/mastering-linux-services/p1.png)

      - [Unit]
          ```
          Description=Custom Shell Logger Service
          ```
          >This line provides a brief description of the service, which helps users and system administrators understand its purpose.

      -  [Service]
          ```
          ExecStart=/home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.sh
          ```
          >This line specifies the command that will be executed when the service starts. It points to the script log_message.sh, which contains the logic for the logging functionality.
          
          ```
          User=amit
          ```
          >This directive indicates that the service will run with the privileges of the specified user (amit). Running services as a non-root user is a security best practice that minimizes potential damage if the service is compromised.
      
      - [Install]
          ```
          WantedBy=multi-user.target
          ```
          >This line defines the target under which the service should be started when enabled. The multi-user.target is a standard runlevel for non-graphical multi-user environments.
      
    
 - Make systemd aware of the update.
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
 - Start the service. 
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl start custom_logger
    ```
  - Check status of the service.
    ```shell
    sudo systemctl status custom_logger
    ```

# Source code change management

What happens to a running service if you update the executable or configuration?

- **Updating the Service File:**
  
  If you make changes to the service file, you need to run `systemctl daemon-reload`. This command tells systemd to reload its configuration and apply any changes made to the service definition.

- **Updating the executable:**
  
  If you update the .sh script without restarting the service, the changes wonâ€™t take effect immediately. `The currently running service instance will continue using the old version of the script until you restart it`.
  
  Here's what happens in this scenario:
    - `Running Instance:` The existing service instance will continue running with the original version of the script that was loaded when the service started.
    - `Pending Changes:` Any modifications to the .sh file will only be applied when the service is restarted (either via `systemctl restart` or by stopping and starting it again).
    - `Long-Running Services:` For services running indefinitely (like daemons), changes will not take effect until you manually restart the service. 
    
        For services that stop and start regularly (e.g., triggered by timers or user actions), the updates will be applied the next time the service starts.

# Advance configuration options

#### [Unit] Section
  - `After=:` Specifies that the service should start only after the specified units have started. This is useful for managing dependencies between services.
  - `Requires=:` Indicates that the specified units must be active for this service to start. If the required unit fails or is stopped, this service will also be stopped.
  - `Wants=:` Similar to **Requires=**, but the specified units are not strictly required for this service to start. This allows for softer dependencies.
  - `ConditionPathExists=:` The service will only start if the specified path exists. This can be useful for conditional execution.

#### [Service] Section
  - `Type=:` Defines how the service is started. Common types include:
      - `simple:` The default; assumes the service is a long-running process.
      - `forking:` Used for services that fork a child process and exit the parent.
      - `oneshot:` For one-time tasks; the service is considered started immediately and does not need to remain active.
      - `notify:` For services that will send a notification message to systemd after startup.
  - `ExecReload=:` Specifies a command to execute when the service is reloaded. This is useful for services that can be gracefully reloaded without needing to be stopped and restarted.
  - `Restart=:` Controls the service restart behavior. Possible values include:
      - `no:` Do not restart the service (default).
      - `on-failure:` Restart only if the service exits with a non-zero status.
      - `always:` Always restart the service regardless of exit status.
      - `on-abort:` Restart only if the service terminates due to an unhandled signal.
      - `TimeoutStartSec=:` Specifies the time to wait for the service to start before considering it failed. If the service does not start in this time, it will be terminated.
      - `TimeoutStopSec=:` Specifies the time to wait for the service to stop gracefully before forcibly terminating it.
  - `User=:` Specifies the user under which the service runs, providing a way to run services with reduced privileges.
  - `Group=:` Similar to User=, but specifies the group under which the service runs.
  - `Environment=:` Allows you to define environment variables that will be available to the service when it runs.
  - `StandardOutput=:` Controls where the standard output of the service goes. 
      
      Options include:
      - `journal:` Send output to the journal.
      - `null:` Discard output.
      - `tty:` Send output to the controlling terminal.
      - `StandardError=:` Similar to StandardOutput=, but for standard error output.

#### [Install] Section
  - `Alias=:` Creates an alias for the service. This can be useful for providing a simpler name for a service that has a more complex name.
  - `WantedBy=:` targets are a way to group units and manage the startup sequence of services. They can be thought of as a logical grouping of services that should be started together. Common targets include `multi-user.target, graphical.target, reboot.target`, and many others.

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Advanced Custom Logger Service
After=network.target
Requires=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/amit/logs
ExecStart=/home/amit/scripts/log_message.sh
User=amit
Environment=LOG_LEVEL=debug
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s
TimeoutStartSec=30s
TimeoutStopSec=10s
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

# Triggering the service 
In **systemd**, services can be triggered to start in various ways, based on different events or conditions. 

Here are some of the most common trigger mechanisms:

- `Target-Based Triggers`
    - `WantedBy and RequiredBy:` These directives in the **[Install]** section of the service file specify the target units that should start this service when the target is reached.
        - `WantedBy=multi-user.target:` The service will start when the system reaches the multi-user mode.
        - `RequiredBy=some.target:` The service cannot start unless the specified target is active.
- `Dependency Triggers`
    - `After= and Before=:` Specify order dependencies between services. A service defined with After= will start only after the specified service has started, while **Before=** ensures it starts before the specified service.
    - `Requires= and Wants=:` These create dependencies, where **Requires=** specifies that the service cannot start unless the required service is active, while Wants= is a softer requirement.

- `Timer Triggers`
    - `Timers:` Instead of cron jobs, you can use systemd timers to trigger services at scheduled intervals.
              Timer units have a **.timer** extension and specify when to start the associated service.
              
              `Example:` A timer unit that starts a backup service every hour.
              
              ```shell
              [Timer]
              OnCalendar=*-*-* 00:00:00
              ```
- `Path Triggers`
    - `PathUnits:` These can be used to monitor filesystem events. When a specified file or directory is modified, created, or deleted, a service can be triggered.
      
      `Example:` A service can be set to start when a specific configuration file is modified.
      
      ```shell
      [Path]
      PathChanged=/etc/custom_service/config.conf
      ```
- `Socket Activation`
    - `Socket Units:` **systemd** can create socket units that listen for incoming connections. When a connection is received, the associated service is started automatically.
      This is common in server applications where the service does not need to be running until it receives a request.
      
      ```shell
      [Socket]
      ListenStream=8080
      ```
- `Notification-Based Triggers`
    - `Type=notify:` Services that use this type can send a notification to systemd when they are fully started. This allows systemd to wait for the service to be fully operational before proceeding with dependent services.
- `Manual Triggers`
    - `Manual Start/Stop:` Services can be started or stopped manually using systemctl commands `(e.g., systemctl start myservice)`. This is often used during development or testing.


# Managing Service state
 A service's state can be managed using the following commands as needed:

```shell
# Displays the current status of the custom_logger service, including whether it is active, inactive, or failed.
sudo systemctl status custom_logger
```

```shell
# Starts the custom_logger service.
sudo systemctl start custom_logger
```

```shell
# Stops the custom_logger service.
sudo systemctl stop custom_logger
```

```shell
# Restarts the custom_logger service.
sudo systemctl restart custom_logger
```

```shell
# Reloads the configuration of the custom_logger service without stopping it.
sudo systemctl reload custom_logger
```

```shell
# Enables the custom_logger service to start automatically on boot.
sudo systemctl enable custom_logger
```

```shell
# Disables the custom_logger service from starting automatically on boot.
sudo systemctl disable custom_logger
```

```shell
# Checks if the custom_logger service is enabled to start automatically on boot.
sudo systemctl is-enabled custom_logger
```

![is enabled](/static/images/blog/mastering-linux-services/p4.png)

```shell
# Lists all active systemd services currently running on the system.
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active
```

# Logging with journalctl

`journalctl` is a command-line tool used to view logs collected by systemd's journal service, allowing you to access system and service logs.

```shell 
# Displays the logs for the custom_logger service.
sudo journalctl -u custom_logger
```

![logs](/static/images/blog/mastering-linux-services/p5.png)

```shell 
# Follows the logs of the custom_logger service in real-time.
sudo journalctl -u custom_logger -f
```

```shell 
# Displays the logs for the custom_logger service since November 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM.
sudo journalctl -u custom_logger --since "2024-11-01 12:00:00"
```

# Using Environment Variables

 ```shell:custom_logger.service
[Unit]
Description=Custom Shell Logger Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.sh
User=amit

EnvironmentFile=/custom_service.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
 ```

```shell 
# Sets the file permissions of /etc/custom_service.env to be readable and writable by the owner, and readable by others.
chmod 644 /etc/custom_service.env
```

 ```shell
 # Shows the environment variables set for the custom_logger service.
 sudo systemctl show custom_logger --property=Environment
```

# Resource Control

Resource control allows you to manage and limit the resources (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.) that a service can use. This is particularly useful when you want to prevent a single service from consuming too many system resources and affecting the overall performance of your server.

- Resource Control Directives
    These are the most common directives you can use in a service file to control resources:

    - `CPU Limits:`
      - `CPUQuota=`: Limit the CPU usage of a service as a percentage of a single CPU. For example, CPUQuota=50% means the service can use up to 50% of one CPU core.
      - `CPUShares=:` Controls the relative weight of CPU time a service gets compared to others. Higher values mean more CPU time.

    - `Memory Limits:`
      - `MemoryLimit=:` Sets the maximum amount of RAM a service can use. For example, MemoryLimit=500M restricts the service to use up to 500 MB of memory.

    - `I/O Limits:`
      - `IOReadBandwidthMax=:` Limits the maximum read bandwidth for a service (e.g., IOReadBandwidthMax=/dev/sda 10M).
      - `IOWriteBandwidthMax=:` Limits the maximum write bandwidth for a service.
    - `Task Limits:`
      - `TasksMax=:` Sets the maximum number of tasks (threads or processes) that a service can create.

 ```shell:custom_logger.service
[Unit]
Description=Custom Shell Logger Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.sh
User=amit

CPUQuota=50%
CPUShares=1024
MemoryLimit=1G

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
 ```

 ```shell 
 # Displays the CPU quota, memory limit, and maximum number of tasks for the custom_service service.
 sudo systemctl show custom_service -p CPUQuota,MemoryLimit,TasksMax
```

# Service Types

The `Type` directive in the `[Service]` section specifies how systemd should start and manage a service. 

```shell:custom_logger.service
[Unit]
Description=Custom Shell Logger Service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/home/amit/personal/blog-content/mastering-linux-services/log_message.sh
User=amit


[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
 ```

 | **Service Type** | **Behavior**                                                                                     | **Use Case**                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `simple`         | Starts the service and considers it active immediately.                                          | Foreground processes             |
| `forking`        | Waits for the service to fork and exit the parent process before marking it active.              | Traditional Unix daemons         |
| `oneshot`        | Runs a command once and exits, usually with `RemainAfterExit=yes`.                               | Initialization tasks             |
| `notify`         | Waits for a notification from the service to indicate readiness.                                 | Complex startup services         |
| `dbus`           | Waits for the service to acquire a specific D-Bus name.                                          | D-Bus services                   |
| `idle`           | Delays service startup until all other jobs have finished during boot.                           | Non-critical services            |
