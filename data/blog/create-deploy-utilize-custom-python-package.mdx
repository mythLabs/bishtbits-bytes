# Introduction

There are many common tasks involved in software development, such as implementing common logic or interacting with third-party APIs. These repetitive tasks can be `standardized and published as a module`, allowing us to assist others and enhance them through a community effort, known as open source software.

So, let's learn how to publish a modularized piece of Python code that can be used by anyone. We will explore the basic building blocks of packages, known as `modules`, and how to create a package and publish it to the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/). Afterwards, we will download it and use it to complete the full cycle.

All the source code from this blog is available [here](https://github.com/mythLabs/blog-content/tree/main/python-package).

# Modules Basics

A [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The filename is the module name with the suffix `.py` appended. Within a module, the module's name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__ name __`.

Below is a simple Python module.

```python:modu.py
st = "John Snow is my favourite"
arr = [123, 4, 56]

def printer(arg):
    print(f'arguments = {arg}')

class InitTest:
    pass
```

> This is a simple Python file containing variable declarations, functions, and class definitions. To test it out as a module, go into the Python command line and import 'modu'.

<b>So, how do we use this module?</b>

```python
import modu
```

It does not make the content of the module directly accessible. Each module has a `private symbol table`, thus creating a separate `namespace`. So, upon importing `modu`, only `modu` is placed in the symbol table, and we can access content using `dot notation`.

![modu import](/static/images/blog/python-package/01.png)

There are multiple ways to import; some are discussed below.

```python
from modu import st
```

We can import a specific variable from the module. By directly adding `st` to the global symbol table, it becomes accessible without a module name. Anything else from the module is not recognized.

![modu import](/static/images/blog/python-package/03.png)

```python
from modu import *
```

With *, we import everything from the module directly into the global symbol table.

![modu import](/static/images/blog/python-package/04.png)

```python
from modu import st as fav
```

Using `as` allows us to create an alias for an imported symbol to counter any potential name collisions.

# Package Basics

> Packages are a way of structuring Python's module namespace by using `dotted module names`.

If we have a complex package with multiple features, imagine [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/) (AWS Python SDK). All its functions are created as separate modules, and all modules together create a package.

Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation. In the same way that modules help avoid collisions between global variable names, packages help avoid collisions between module names.


Let's create a simple package with two modules.

```python:modu1.py
st = "jaime lannister is my favourite"
arr = [123, 4, 56]

def printer(arg):
    print(f'arguments = {arg}')
```

```python:modu2.py
st = "Tyrion Lannister is my favourite"
arr = [123, 4, 56]

def printer(arg):
    print(f'arguments = {arg}')
```

Both of the above files are placed in a folder called `pack`, thus making it a package of modules.

<b>So, how do we use this package?</b>

```python
import pack.modu1, pack.modu2
```

Since a package is a hierarchical structure, we can use dot notation to import a particular module from the package and use it.

![package import](/static/images/blog/python-package/06.png)

```python
from pack.modu1 import st
```

We can also import a particular functionality from the package's module directly into the global symbol table.

![package import](/static/images/blog/python-package/07.png)

```python
from pack.modu2 import st as say
```

Importing with an alias allows us to provide a different name for a module or its components when importing them.

![package import](/static/images/blog/python-package/08.png)

<b>__ init __.py</b>

```python:__init__.py
print(f'Initializing package name {__name__}')
greatHouses = ['stark', 'Lannister' ]
```

When we import the package, if this file is present, it will be invoked. This can be used for the execution of package initialization code, like this.

![package init](/static/images/blog/python-package/09.png)

Initialized data can be further utilized in modules.

```diff-yaml:modu1.py
st = "jaime lannister is my favourite"
arr = [123, 4, 56]

def printer(arg):
    print(f'arguments = {arg}')

+ def printRivals():
+   from pack import greatHouses
+   print(greatHouses)
```

# Directory structure of a package

A package does not only contain modules; it also includes documentation, licenses, unit tests, package metadata, build instructions, and more.

![directory structor](/static/images/blog/python-package/02.png)

Let's understand what each file in the tree above is used for:

- <b>package_name:</b> Represents the main package.
- <b>docs:</b> It includes documentation files on how to use the package.
- <b>scripts:</b> Top-level scripts.
- <b>src:</b> Code goes here. It contains packages, modules, sub-packages, etc.
- <b>tests:</b> Unit tests.
- <b>LICENSE.txt:</b> Contains the text of the license.
- <b>CHANGES.txt:</b> Log the changes of each release.
- <b>MANIFEST.in:</b> Instructions on what extra files you want to include (non-code files).
- <b>README.txt:</b> Contains the package description.
- <b>pyproject.toml:</b> Register your build tools.
- <b>setup.py:</b> Contains the build script for your build tools (existence depends on build tool).
- <b>setup.cfg:</b> Configuration file of your build tools (existence depends on build tool).

# Creating a basic package

Now that we have some knowledge about packages, let's create one.

Let's create a folder named [got_spoiler](https://github.com/mythLabs/blog-content/tree/main/python-package/03.create-package/got_spoiler/src/got_spoiler) containing two modules and an init file.

```python:__init__.py
print("Your IP address has been sent to a white walker !!!")
```

```python:death.py
import random

def can(name):
    res = bool(random.getrandbits(1))
    if res == True:
        ep = random.randrange(1,9)
        print(f"{name} is going to die in episode {ep}")
    else:
        print(f"By the grace of old gods, {name} will survive")
```

A module that randomly predicts whether your Game of Thrones character will die.

![module death](/static/images/blog/python-package/11.png)

```python:review.py
def season(num):
    if num >= 1 and num <= 5:
        print("Epic")
        return("Epic")
    elif num == 6:
        print("Great")
    elif num == 7:
        print("Mehh")
    elif num == 8:
        print("It does not exist")
    else:
        print("lol")
```
And this module reviews Game of Thrones seasons.

So, this is the core of our package. Now, we need a bunch of supporting files.

We need `unit test cases`.

```python:test_spoilers_review.py
import sys
sys.path.append(r'./src')

import unittest
from spoilers import review 

class TestReview(unittest.TestCase):

	def test_review(self):
		self.assertEqual(review.season(1),"Epic")

unittest.main()
```

> We are appending our source code path thorugh sys.path while running this test to let the interpreter know from where to import our module.

<b>run:</b> `python tests/test_spoilers_review.py`

Now, add a `setup.cfg` file that contains all the metadata about the package; it's pretty much self-explanatory.

```txt:setup.cfg
[metadata]
name = got_spoiler
version = 1.0.0
author = mythLabs
author_email = amitbisht744@gmail.com
description = A simple testing package
long_description = file: README.md, LICENSE.txt
long_description_content_type = text/markdown
url = https://github.com/mythLabs
project_urls =
    Bug Tracker = https://github.com/mythLabs
    repository = https://github.com/mythLabs
classifiers =
    Programming Language :: Python :: 3
    License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License
    Operating System :: OS Independent

[options]
package_dir =
    = src
packages = find:
python_requires = >=3.6

[options.packages.find]
where = src
```

Now, to build this source, we will be using the Python package [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html), and we need a file named `pyproject.toml` to register the build system. There are multiple other build systems like [flit](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) that we would need to manipulate just these files.

```txt:pyproject.tom
[build-system]
requires = ['setuptools>=42']
build-backend = 'setuptools.build_meta'
```

At last, add a [README.md](https://github.com/mythLabs/blog-content/blob/main/python-package/03.create-package/got_spoiler/README.md) and [LICENSE.txt](https://github.com/mythLabs/blog-content/blob/main/python-package/03.create-package/got_spoiler/LICENSE.txt).

Now, to build it, we first install the package [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/) and then run it.

<b>run:</b> `python -m pip install --upgrade build`
![install build](/static/images/blog/python-package/12.png)

<b>run:</b> `python -m build`
![run build](/static/images/blog/python-package/13.png)

Now, we can see the distributables are generated in the /dist folder. The `.tar.gz` file is the source archive and the `.whl` file is the built archive. Both will be uploaded to the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) and installed by package installer [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

# Uploading the package

Python packages are uploaded to the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), but since we have to test our package, we will upload it to the [test version](https://test.pypi.org/) of the Python Package Index.

First, we would need to create an account and obtain an API key to upload our package.

- Go to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) and create an account.
- Go to 'api-tokens' and create your API token to securely upload your packages.
  ![run build](/static/images/blog/python-package/14.png)
- While creating, set the scope to 'entire account'.
- Copy the token.

Now, to upload it, we need a tool called [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/); it's the official PyPI upload tool.

Now, let's go ahead and run these commands

<b>run:</b> `python -m pip install --upgrade twine`

<b>run:</b> `python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`

![run build](/static/images/blog/python-package/15.png)

And now you can see the uploaded package on the test index.

[Link to package](https://test.pypi.org/project/got-spoiler/)

# Using the installed package

I created a file that uses our package.

```python:usage.py
from got_spoiler import death, review

print(death.can("Ned Stark"))
print(review.season(8))
```
So, we install the package now by running the command below:

<b>run:</b> `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/got-spoiler`

![run build](/static/images/blog/python-package/16.png)

Now, we just run our 'usage.py'.

<b>run:</b> `python usage.py`

![run build](/static/images/blog/python-package/17.png)

# Uploading to real python package index

After the package testing is successful, we will upload it to the real index.

- Go to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and create an account.
- Run `python -m twine upload dist/*` in the terminal/command line; we don't need to specify the repository flag this time.
- Enter the account credentials/API token you registered for on the actual PyPI.
- Then, run pip install [package_name] to install your package.
