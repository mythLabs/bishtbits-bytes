# Introduction

Web security is one of the most critical aspects of modern application
development. Browsers act as the first line of defense for users by
enforcing a variety of **security mechanisms**. 

These mechanisms are designed to prevent malicious sites from stealing data, hijacking
sessions, or executing unauthorized scripts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Same-Origin Policy (SOP)

Browsers operate under the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**, which states
that a script on one origin (a combination of scheme, host, and port)
cannot access resources from another origin. For example:

-   `https://example.com` is considered different from
    `https://api.example.com`.
-   `https://example.com:8080` is different from
    `https://example.com:443`.

This **default isolation** ensures that malicious websites cannot
arbitrarily read data from other origins.

However, real-world applications often need controlled cross-origin
communication, which brings us to **CORS**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

CORS is a mechanism that allows servers to specify which origins are
permitted to access their resources. Without CORS, browsers block most
cross-origin requests for security reasons.

### How CORS Works:

1.  **Preflight Requests** (using `OPTIONS` method):
    -   For non-simple requests (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`, or custom
        headers), the browser sends a preflight `OPTIONS` request.

    -   The server responds with headers like:

        ``` http
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
        ```
2.  **Simple Requests**:
    -   For simple cases (like `GET` or `POST` with standard headers),
        no preflight is needed.
3.  **Credentialed Requests**:
    -   To send cookies or authorization headers, the server must
        explicitly allow it:

        ``` http
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
        ```

### Common Misconfigurations:

-   Using `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with
    `Allow-Credentials: true` â†’ **Not allowed** by browsers.
-   Forgetting to restrict origins properly can open doors for data
    leaks.

**Best Practice**: Always restrict CORS to trusted origins and avoid
wildcards for sensitive endpoints.

## Same-Site Cookies

Cookies are central to maintaining user sessions, but they can be abused
in **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attacks. To mitigate this,
browsers introduced the **SameSite cookie attribute**.

### SameSite Options:

1.  **Strict**:
    -   Cookie is sent only for same-site requests.
    -   Most secure, but can break cross-site login flows.
2.  **Lax** (Default in modern browsers):
    -   Cookie is sent for top-level navigations (like clicking a link),
        but not for background requests.
3.  **None**:
    -   Cookie is sent with all requests, but must be marked `Secure`
        (HTTPS only).

### Example:

``` http
Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; SameSite=Strict; Secure; HttpOnly
```

**Best Practice**: Use `Strict` or `Lax` wherever possible. Use
`None` only when truly necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP is a powerful browser feature to mitigate **Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS)** and data injection attacks.

### How CSP Works:

-   Developers define which resources (scripts, images, styles) are
    allowed to load.
-   Browser blocks everything else.

### Example Policy:

``` http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com
```

This ensures only scripts from your own origin and Google APIs can run.

### Benefits of CSP:

-   Prevents execution of injected scripts.
-   Blocks loading of malicious third-party content.
-   Supports reporting for violations (`report-uri` or `report-to`).

**Best Practice**: Start with **Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only**
to monitor violations before enforcing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **X-Frame-Options / CSP frame-ancestors**

Prevents **Clickjacking** by controlling whether a page can be embedded
in an `<iframe>`.

-   Example:

    ``` http
    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    ```

## **X-Content-Type-Options**

Prevents MIME-type sniffing, reducing risk of content misinterpretation.

``` http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

## **Referrer-Policy**

Controls how much referrer information is shared during navigation.

``` http
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade
```

## **Feature Policy (Permissions Policy)**

Restricts access to APIs like camera, microphone, or geolocation.

``` http
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Advanced Browser Security Mechanisms

### 1. **Subresource Integrity (SRI)**

SRI ensures that files loaded from third-party CDNs (like scripts or
styles) haven't been tampered with.\
It uses cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity of resources.

**Example:**

``` html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"
        integrity="sha384-oWq2...hash...9uR4"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If the file's content doesn't match the hash, the browser blocks it.

**Best Practice**: Always use SRI when loading external
scripts/styles from CDNs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. **Sandboxed Iframes**

`<iframe>` elements can be sandboxed to isolate untrusted content.\
The `sandbox` attribute restricts capabilities like script execution,
form submission, or navigation.

**Example:**

``` html
<iframe src="https://untrusted.com" sandbox="allow-scripts"></iframe>
```

-   By default, all powerful features are disabled.
-   You can selectively allow features (e.g., `allow-scripts`,
    `allow-forms`).

**Best Practice**: Always sandbox third-party iframes to reduce risks
from untrusted content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. **Browser Isolation**

Modern browsers (like Chrome's **Site Isolation**) run different origins
in separate processes.\
This limits the impact of attacks like **Spectre/Meltdown** by isolating
memory between sites.

-   Helps contain compromised sites.
-   Adds another layer of defense against side-channel attacks.

**Best Practice**: Rely on default browser isolation features and
avoid disabling them for performance reasons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. **Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)**

Ensures that a top-level browsing context is isolated from other origins by controlling how windows interact with each other.

- With Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin, the page gets its own browsing context group, preventing untrusted cross-origin pages from accessing window.opener.

- Protects against side-channel leaks and Spectre-type vulnerabilities.

**Example:**

```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 5. **Cross-Origin Embedder Policy (COEP)**

Ensures that all resources loaded by your page are explicitly marked as safe to be embedded.

- With Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp, the browser requires resources (scripts, images, etc.) to opt-in via Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (CORP) or CORS headers.

- Prevents loading of cross-origin resources unless explicitly permitted.

```http 
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

Modern browsers provide a robust set of **security mechanisms** to
protect users against common web threats. Features like **CORS,
SameSite, CSP, and security headers** enforce strict boundaries and
minimize attack vectors.

Advanced features like **Subresource Integrity, sandboxed iframes, and
browser isolation** further harden the browser environment.

As a developer, it's crucial to **understand, configure, and test**
these mechanisms properly. Misconfigurations can weaken your app's
security posture, while correct usage provides strong protection for
your users.
